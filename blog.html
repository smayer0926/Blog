      <h1>Washington Hikes</h1>
      <p>Some of the best hikes in the country are in the state of Washington. Travel all around to see the dense, <span class="tree">deciduous</span> forests of the upper left coast. Only a few hours from major cities such as Portland and Seattle, access is unparalled.</p>
      <h1>Oregon Hikes</h1>
      <p>One of the largest and most diverse ecosystems in the area, Oregon boasts snowcapped volcanic peaks, down to dry aried deserts in the east. The dense verdant forests are unlike any in other parts of the country. Cascading waterfalls are flush in the spring with glacial melt running into the rivers and streams. </p>
      <h1>California Hikes</h1>
      <p>California has some of the most inviting environments. Northern California has the wonderful Sierra Nevada. In the valleys to the west, some of the <span class="grapes">finest grapes</span> are grown for wine. California has the 5th largest economy in the world.</p>
